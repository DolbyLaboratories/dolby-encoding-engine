# dolby-encoding-engine

This repository contains various additions to Dolby Encoding Engine (DEE), such as plugins allowing integration of 3rd part components.

:mega: If you need stable source code, use [release archives](https://github.com/DolbyLaboratories/dolby-encoding-engine/releases) to get components associated with specific DEE version.

Master branch is updated outside of DEE release schedule.
It may happen, that master branch is ahead of DEE release and contains compatibility-breaking changes. In that case, published components cannot be used with latest, public DEE release.
